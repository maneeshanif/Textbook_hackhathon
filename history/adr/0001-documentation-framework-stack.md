# ADR-0001: Documentation Framework Stack

> **Scope**: Document decision clusters, not individual technology choices. Group related decisions that work together (e.g., "Frontend Stack" not separate ADRs for framework, styling, deployment).

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2025-12-06
- **Feature:** 001-docusaurus-book
- **Context:** Building an interactive online textbook for "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics" requires a documentation-first framework that supports MDX for rich content, i18n for multi-language support (English + Urdu with RTL), dark/light themes, and strong TypeScript support. The textbook needs ~20 pages across 4 chapters with custom components for difficulty badges and chatbot placeholders.

## Decision

We will use the following integrated documentation stack:

- **Framework**: Docusaurus 3.6.x (React-based documentation framework)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.3+ with strict mode
- **Content Format**: MDX 3.x for rich interactive content
- **UI Library**: React 18.2+ (bundled with Docusaurus)
- **Styling**: CSS Modules + Docusaurus Infima CSS framework
- **Build Target**: Static site generation (SSG)
- **Deployment Target**: GitHub Pages or Vercel

## Consequences

### Positive

- Native i18n support with RTL handling eliminates custom localization work
- Built-in dark/light theme with localStorage persistence
- Autogenerated sidebar from folder structure reduces maintenance
- MDX allows React components directly in documentation
- Excellent TypeScript support via `@docusaurus/types`
- Large ecosystem with active community and plugins
- Fast builds with incremental compilation
- SEO-optimized static output

### Negative

- Docusaurus-specific conventions create framework coupling
- Learning curve for MDX and Docusaurus theming system
- Limited flexibility compared to custom React apps
- Upgrade path may require migration effort for major versions
- Bundle size includes full React runtime (~100KB gzipped)

## Alternatives Considered

**Alternative A: Nextra (Next.js-based)**
- Pros: Full Next.js flexibility, App Router support, great DX
- Cons: Less mature i18n, more manual theme setup, smaller ecosystem
- Rejected: Docusaurus has superior i18n and RTL support out-of-box

**Alternative B: GitBook**
- Pros: No-code editing, hosted solution, collaboration features
- Cons: Limited customization, vendor lock-in, no custom React components
- Rejected: Need custom MDX components for difficulty badges and chatbot

**Alternative C: Astro + Starlight**
- Pros: Partial hydration, faster runtime, modern stack
- Cons: Younger ecosystem, less battle-tested i18n
- Rejected: Docusaurus more mature for documentation-heavy use case
