# Chapter 2: Humanoid Robotics Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Understand **forward and inverse kinematics** for humanoid robots
- Apply **dynamics** principles to analyze forces and torques in robotic systems
- Explain **bipedal locomotion** strategies (ZMP, whole-body control)
- Design basic **gait patterns** for humanoid walking
- Analyze **stability** and balance control mechanisms

## Chapter Overview

This chapter builds the mathematical and engineering foundations needed to design and control humanoid robots. We move from the conceptual overview in Chapter 1 to the rigorous technical details that enable bipedal walking, manipulation, and dynamic motion.

Key topics include:

- **Kinematics**: How robot joint angles relate to end-effector positions
- **Dynamics**: Forces, torques, and motion equations
- **Locomotion**: Walking strategies and gait generation
- **Balance Control**: Maintaining stability during motion

## Prerequisites

- Linear algebra (vectors, matrices, transformations)
- Calculus (derivatives, integrals)
- Basic physics (Newton's laws, rigid body dynamics)
- Python programming (for exercises)
