## Computer Vision Problems

### Problem 1: Object Detection Pipeline
**Difficulty:** Beginner

Implement a simple object detection pipeline using YOLOv8 to count the number of people in a video stream.

<details>
<summary>Solution Code</summary>

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
import cv2

model = YOLO('yolov8n.pt')
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('test_video.mp4')

total_people = 0

while cap.isOpened():
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    
    results = model(frame)
    
    # Count people (class ID 0 in COCO dataset)
    people_count = sum(1 for box in results[0].boxes if int(box.cls[0]) == 0)
    total_people = max(total_people, people_count)
    
    cv2.putText(frame, f"People: {people_count}", (10, 30),
                cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 255, 0), 2)
    cv2.imshow('Detection', frame)
    
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
print(f"Max people detected: {total_people}")
```

## Reinforcement Learning Problems

### Problem 2: CartPole with RL
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

Train a simple policy network to balance a CartPole using REINFORCE algorithm.

<details>
<summary>Solution Outline</summary>

```python
import gym
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

class PolicyNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_dim, action_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(state_dim, 128),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(128, action_dim),
            nn.Softmax(dim=-1)
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
policy = PolicyNetwork(state_dim=4, action_dim=2)
optimizer = optim.Adam(policy.parameters(), lr=1e-2)

for episode in range(500):
    state = env.reset()[0]
    log_probs, rewards = [], []
    
    done = False
    while not done:
        state_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(state)
        action_probs = policy(state_tensor)
        action = torch.multinomial(action_probs, 1).item()
        
        next_state, reward, done, _, _ = env.step(action)
        
        log_probs.append(torch.log(action_probs[action]))
        rewards.append(reward)
        
        state = next_state
    
    # Compute returns
    returns = []
    R = 0
    for r in reversed(rewards):
        R = r + 0.99 * R
        returns.insert(0, R)
    returns = torch.tensor(returns)
    returns = (returns - returns.mean()) / (returns.std() + 1e-9)
    
    # Policy gradient update
    loss = -sum(log_prob * R for log_prob, R in zip(log_probs, returns))
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    
    if episode % 50 == 0:
        print(f"Episode {episode}: Total Reward = {sum(rewards)}")
```

**Expected Result**: Policy should reach 200+ steps after ~200-300 episodes.

## Application Analysis

### Problem 3: Robot Selection
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

You are tasked with selecting a humanoid robot for a warehouse automation project. Compare Tesla Optimus, Figure 01, and Unitree H1 across these criteria:
- Cost (estimated)
- Runtime (battery life)
- Payload capacity
- AI capabilities
- Commercial availability

Which would you choose and why?

<details>
<summary>Example Answer</summary>

**Comparison Table:**

| Criterion | Tesla Optimus | Figure 01 | Unitree H1 |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|------------|
| **Cost** | $20k-$30k (est.) | Unknown | $90k |
| **Runtime** | Unknown | 4-5 hours | ~2 hours |
| **Payload** | ~20 kg | ~10 kg | ~5 kg |
| **AI** | Vision-language (FSD-inspired) | OpenAI VLM | Basic RL |
| **Availability** | Not yet commercial | Limited deployment | Available for research |

**Recommendation: Figure 01**

**Justification**:
1. **Commercial Readiness**: Already deployed in BMW factory (proven track record)
2. **AI Integration**: OpenAI VLM enables natural language commands
3. **Runtime**: 4-5 hours sufficient for warehouse shifts with charging breaks
4. **Payload**: 10 kg adequate for most packages

**Alternative**: If cost is critical and you have in-house AI expertise, wait for Tesla Optimus (lower projected cost).

## Research Question

### Problem 4: Ethical Considerations
**Difficulty:** Advanced

Write a 500-word essay addressing:
- Should humanoid robots be deployed in eldercare homes?
- What are the potential benefits and risks?
- How can we ensure ethical deployment?

---

## Key Takeaways

- Computer vision (YOLO, SLAM) is critical for perception
- Reinforcement learning enables trial-and-error optimization
- Real-world deployment requires robustness, safety, and cost-effectiveness
- Ethical considerations must guide technology development
