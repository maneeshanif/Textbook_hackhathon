# 1.3 Historical Development

## Timeline of Humanoid Robotics

### Early Automatons (Pre-1900s)

**Ancient Greece** (350 BCE):
- Mechanical birds and automated theaters described by Hero of Alexandria

**Medieval Period** (1206):
- Al-Jazari's programmable humanoid musicians and drink-serving robots

**18th Century**:
- Jacques de Vaucanson's Flute Player (1737) — mechanical humanoid that played music
- Pierre Jaquet-Droz's The Writer (1770) — a mechanical boy that could write text

### The Electromechanical Era (1900-1980)

**Elektro (1939)** — Westinghouse Electric
- First humanoid robot exhibited at World's Fair
- Could walk, speak 700 words, and smoke cigarettes
- Remote-controlled, not autonomous

**Shakey (1966-1972)** — Stanford Research Institute
- First mobile robot with AI reasoning
- Wheeled base, not humanoid, but pioneered AI planning

**WABOT-1 (1973)** — Waseda University, Japan
- First full-scale humanoid robot
- Could walk, grip objects, and measure distances
- Lacked real-time sensing and dynamic balance

### Modern Humanoid Robotics (1980-2000)

**Honda E-Series (1986-1993)**
- Honda began secret humanoid robot research
- **E0 (1986)**: First prototype, could walk at 5 seconds per step
- **E6 (1993)**: Walking at human speed, 4.7 km/h

**Honda P-Series (1993-1997)**
- **P1 (1993)**: First self-sufficient humanoid (onboard computer and battery)
- **P2 (1996)**: 1.82m tall, 210 kg, wireless remote control
- **P3 (1997)**: 1.60m, 130 kg, improved mobility

**ASIMO (2000)** — Honda
- **Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility**
- Height: 1.3m, Weight: 54 kg
- Could walk at 1.6 km/h, climb stairs, recognize faces
- Became the most famous humanoid robot of the 2000s

### The Research Platform Era (2000-2015)

**HRP Series (2002-2011)** — Japan
- Humanoid Robotics Project by AIST
- HRP-2, HRP-3, HRP-4: research platforms for walking, manipulation, disaster response

**QRIO (2003)** — Sony
- Small humanoid (58 cm, 7 kg)
- Could run, dance, and recognize faces
- Discontinued in 2006

**HUBO (2004)** — Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)
- Won DARPA Robotics Challenge (2015)
- Featured wheeled knees for fast mobility

**NAO (2006)** — Aldebaran Robotics (now SoftBank Robotics)
- 58 cm tall, 25 DOF
- Programmable platform for education and research
- Used in RoboCup Standard Platform League

**iCub (2006)** — Italian Institute of Technology
- 1.04m tall child-sized robot
- Open-source platform for cognitive development research

### The Boston Dynamics Revolution (2013-Present)

**Atlas (2013)**
- Hydraulic humanoid, 1.5m tall, 150 kg (original), now 89 kg
- DARPA Robotics Challenge competitor
- **2016**: First backflip by a humanoid robot
- **2023**: Fully autonomous warehouse navigation

**Spot (2016)** — Quadruped robot
- While not humanoid, demonstrated robust locomotion and commercialization

### The AI-Powered Era (2020-Present)

**Tesla Optimus (2021-Present)**
- Announced 2021, Gen 1 revealed 2022, Gen 2 in 2023
- Vision: affordable ($20k-30k) general-purpose humanoid
- AI-driven end-to-end learning (FSD technology adapted for humanoids)

**Figure 01 (2023)**
- Partnership with OpenAI for vision-language control
- Can perform warehouse tasks and understand natural language

**1X Neo Beta (2024)**
- Android-like humanoid with human-like appearance
- Electric actuation, biomimetic design

**Unitree H1 (2023)**
- Affordable research platform ($90,000)
- 360° lidar vision, full-body torque control

## Key Milestones

| Year | Milestone | Significance |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 1973 | WABOT-1 | First full-scale humanoid |
| 1996 | Honda P2 | First self-sufficient bipedal robot |
| 2000 | ASIMO | Cultural icon, demonstrated practical mobility |

## Technological Enablers

**1980s-1990s**: Computational Power
- Onboard computers became small enough to fit in robots

**2000s**: Sensors and Control
- Improved IMUs, force sensors, and whole-body control algorithms

**2010s**: Deep Learning
- Computer vision breakthroughs (ImageNet, CNNs) enabled robust perception

**2020s**: Sim-to-Real and Generative AI
- Physics simulators (Isaac Sim, MuJoCo) enable safe training
- Vision-language models (GPT-4V, Gemini) enable natural language control

## Key Takeaways

- Humanoid robotics evolved from mechanical toys to AI-powered systems over 250+ years
- Honda's ASIMO (2000) was the first widely recognized bipedal humanoid
- Boston Dynamics' Atlas (2013) demonstrated dynamic, acrobatic locomotion
