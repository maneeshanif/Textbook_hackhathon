# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- Define **Physical AI** and **embodied intelligence**
- Distinguish between traditional AI and Physical AI systems
- Identify key applications of Physical AI in robotics
- Understand the historical development of humanoid robotics
- Recognize the interdisciplinary nature of Physical AI research

## Chapter Overview

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from purely digital intelligence to systems that can perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that operates in virtual environments, Physical AI is **embodied**—it exists in physical form with sensors, actuators, and the ability to manipulate real-world objects.

This chapter introduces the foundational concepts of Physical AI and humanoid robotics. We explore:

- **What is Physical AI?** — The intersection of artificial intelligence, robotics, and embodied cognition
- **Why Humanoid Robots?** — The advantages and challenges of human-like robot morphology
- **Historical Context** — Key milestones from early automatons to modern humanoid systems
- **Current Landscape** — State-of-the-art humanoid robots and research directions

## Prerequisites

This textbook assumes:

- Basic programming knowledge (Python recommended)
- Fundamental understanding of linear algebra and calculus
- Familiarity with basic physics concepts (force, torque, kinematics)
